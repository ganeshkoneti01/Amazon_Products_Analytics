## Introduction
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of Amazon sales data for Q1 2023 in India.
It offers insights into key sales metrics across various dimensions such as city, state, and product category. 
The dashboard is designed to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by highlighting trends and performance across different geographic regions and product categories.

## Problem Statement
The primary goal of this project was to analyze Amazon's sales data for the first quarter of 2023, providing key insights into regional and product-level performance. 
This analysis was aimed at identifying top-performing regions, understanding customer behavior, and aiding in strategic decision-making for future sales growth.
Steps Followed by Data Analyst to Create the Dashboard
1.	Data Collection
Imported and cleaned sales data for Amazon’s Q1 performance in India, ensuring data accuracy and consistency for analysis.
2.	Data Modeling
Created a structured data model in Power BI with relevant tables for cities, states, products, and sales metrics, establishing relationships between tables for dynamic reporting.
3.	Visualization Design
Designed a three-page interactive dashboard with the following components:
o	Overview Page: Sales by city, state, and month, using card visuals for total sales (76.03M), and bar charts for city/state breakdown (e.g., Maharashtra 13M, Karnataka 10M).
o	Product Analytics: Tooltips for sales amount, sales units, and reviews for each product, providing detailed product performance metrics.
o	Product Insights: Slicers for category and sales status, allowing users to drill down into specific segments.
4.	Interactivity and User Experience
Implemented dynamic slicers for filtering by category and sales status. Added tooltips for detailed product-level insights and a navigator bar for seamless page navigation.
5.	Data Analysis
Used Power BI's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key metrics such as total sales, sales by region, and product performance, ensuring accurate representation of data.
6.	Insights Generation
Identified top-performing regions, with Maharashtra and Karnataka leading in sales, and highlighted opportunities for growth in underperforming areas.

## Insights
•	Maharashtra had the highest sales with 13M, driven by strong customer demand, followed by Karnataka with 10M, largely due to the performance of Bengaluru.
•	The overall sales for Q1 amounted to 76.03M, with variations in performance across cities and states.
•	Product-level analysis using tooltips showed high customer engagement for certain product categories, enabling better decision-making for inventory management and marketing.

## Conclusion
The Amazon Products Analytics dashboard effectively provides actionable insights into sales performance across India for Q1 2023. 
By leveraging interactive features like slicers and tooltips, users can drill down into specific regions and product categories to inform strategic decisions.
 This analysis helps optimize sales efforts and identify growth opportunities in key regions, driving better business outcomes for Amazon.
